# Based in Austin, Texas

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="assets/Myr_logo.png" alt="megayear" width=200/></p>

Our research collective is based at the University of Texas Department of Astronomy, in the Physics, Math, and Astronomy (PMA) building.  


## Software Architecture Projects

Our collective currently has four ongoing software architecture projects.

- [muler](https://muler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python API for data from echelle spectrographs.
- [gollum](https://gollum-astro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python API for precomputed sytnethetic stellar spectral models of stars and brown dwarfs.
- [blasé](https://blase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a PyTorch-based framework that adapts machine learning to high-grasp stellar échelle spectroscopy. 
- [ynot](https://ynot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an image-modeling framework for raw 2D echellograms aimed at precision extraction of low signal-to-noise ratio stellar spectra.


## People

[gully](http://gully.github.io) is the founding member of the research collective and a full-time research fellow at UT Austin.

### Now recruiting new members
We are actively recruiting new members as of January 2022.  We seek UT Austin undergraduate or graduate students with some experience with Python programming.  Our collective will help grow your skills and knowledge through practical open source computational astrophysics research.  To apply, please email gully or other group members with an introduction about yourself and your interests.
